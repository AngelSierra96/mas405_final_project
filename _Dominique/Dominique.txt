This is your personal folder. Put your code here for the analysis. When we reconvene a master file will be  //
created with the necessary pieces of  each person's code. This document is mostly so that GitHub will       //
recognize the folders I created. 

Ideas
--consider extracting data from API (twitter, facebook, instagram)
--can analyze sentiments from movie ratings, identify ratings that are similar to our sonnets, 
     --> can look at movie genres
     --> movie ratings 



--keyword extraction --> assigne keywords to groups --> text classification algorithm
     --need to train algorithm first
     --find list of emotions and associated words

--sentiment analysis --> topic analyzer


--> classifications become new variable, where each sonnet has some assoicated sentiment/feeling/emotion
--> we find other data that has similar keywords and look for interesting findings
